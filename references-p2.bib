@article{ritchie2003remote,
  title={Remote sensing techniques to assess water quality},

  volume={69},
  number={6},
  pages={695--704},
  year={2003},
  publisher={American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing},
  notes={
      - remote sensing can be used to monitor optically-active water quality parameters e.g. turbidity, chlorophyll, and temperature
      - remote sensing platforms are also excellent for change-detection at small spatial scales
      - useful for resource management
      - suspended sediment: most common pollutant by weight/volume in surface waters of freshwater systems. Measurements affected by    
                            type, texture, color, viewing geometry, and water depth
      - algae/chlorophyll: monitoring is important for managing eutrophication. Determination by remote sensing can be confounded by 
                           presence of suspended sediments. HSI data can help distinguish between algal groups, e.g. green vs blue algae.
      - aquatic vascular plants: overgrowth of macrophytes can clog reservoirs. Focus on three species: hyacinth, hydrilla, giant 
                                 salvinia. UAV systems can be used to detect noxious aquatic weeds.
      - temperature: remote sensing can be used to map thermal discharge into water bodies.

  notes={
      - Mixed pixels
        - low spatial resolution means multiple materials co-occupy a single pixel
        - disparete sources combine into a homogenous mixture
      - Linear Mixing Model
        - Assumption: surface dominated by small number of materials  (endmembers) with consistant spectral properties
        - Two requirements for abundances: nonnegativity and sum-to-one
        - Argument for LMM: at the resolution of georectified images, we can think of pixels as being linear 
          combinations of constituents. Any nonlinear mixtures will have mixing scales with fundamental lengths less thatn the pixel scale.
