  %   \textbf{Proposal:}\newline
  %   The rapid pace of global change poses a significant and ever present threat
  %   to human well-being. To facilitate the development of remediation
  %   technologies and to enable effective mitigation strategies, we must make
  %   data-driven decisions. However, the limitations posed by the lack of highly
  %   available, highly resolved data coupled together with the computational
  %   diï¬€iculties posed by direct simulation of physics at scale severely
  %   constrains our ability to make the low uncertainty predictions needed to
  %   meaningfully address these challenges in real time. This dissertation
  %   presents novel machine learning strategies for combining physics knowledge
  %   with data driven methods in three key case studies. In the first, we
  %   demonstrate the ability for a coordinated robotic team to estimate the
  %   concentration of chemicals-of-concern \textit{in real time} by using machine
  %   learning to map reflectance spectra captured by an autonomous aerial drone
  %   directly to chemical concentrations with associated uncertainty estimates.
  %   In the second study, we present a novel technique for using temporal
  %   variograms to estimate the intrinsic uncertainty of low cost air quality
  %   sensors directly from their time series. Additionally, we implement two
  %   physics informed machine learning methods to model these collected time
  %   series enabling the identification of acute pollution events by modeling
  %   them as the result of external forcing. Finally, in the third study, we
  %   present the most comprehensive analysis of indoor air quality to date, which
  %   includes multi-component observations, a detailed chemical reaction
  %   mechanism (including ion chemistry), an extensive evaluation of indoor
  %   photolysis, and full chemical data assimilation (both 4D Var and a full
  %   Kalman filter) with detailed multi-component error analysis.
