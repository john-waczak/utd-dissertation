## Eigen-stuff and the Singular Value Decomposition


Begin with a general description of the utility of eigen-stuff type analysis. Then explain how the SVD is the natural extension of this to non-square systems (rectangular matrices). Further expand by illustrating the application to principal component analysis. Make sure to comment on the general utility of decomposing a function/vector/signal into a (infinite) linear combination of (stationary) modes with simple time evolution.
