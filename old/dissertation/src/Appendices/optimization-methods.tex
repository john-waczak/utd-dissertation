\chapter{Optimization Methods}

Describe standard gradient descent and it's utility for machine learning. Expand to briefly describe the extensions used in our work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gradient Descent
\item Gradient Descent with Momentum
\item ADAM
\item BFGS
\item LBFGS
\item The method we used for the variogram method that works specifically for quadratic loss functions...
\end{itemize}

We should also comment on which particular methods are best (and when)
