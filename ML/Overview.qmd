# Machine Learning

discuss role in science in particular (i.e. calibration, modeling, etc...)

discuss pushback against use in science and need for methods which simultaneously provide uncertainty bounds. Also describe types of ML e.g. supervised, unsupervised, generative, etc...

this is a good place for the Chihuahua vs Muffin meme... and use this to motivate incorportating physical knowledge into the machine learning process as a key feature for scientific applications... we have more constraints!

also discuss statistical v.s. deep learning
