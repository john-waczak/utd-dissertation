In this study, we address two key limitations of current remote sensing approaches to characterize water quality: namely, the limited spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution provided by existing satellite platforms and the lack of comprehensive in situ measurements needed to validate remote sensing data products. By equipping an autonomous USV with a suite of reference sensors, we rapidly collect significantly more data than existing approaches that rely on the collection of individual samples for lab analysis or are constrained to continuous sensing at fixed sites. Utilizing an autonomous UAV equipped with a hyperspectral imager in tandem with the USV allows us to quickly generate aligned datasets that are used to train machine learning models mapping measured reflectance spectra to the desired water quality variables. By virtue of this increased data volume, we are able to simultaneously estimate the uncertainty of our models by using conformal prediction. Finally, the hyperspectral data cube processing workflow employed onboard the UAV makes it possible to deploy these trained models to swiftly generate maps of the target variables across bodies of water. The rapid turnaround time from data collection to model deployment is critical for real-time water quality evaluation and risk assessment.
