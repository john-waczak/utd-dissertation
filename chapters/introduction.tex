- The rapid pace of global change increasingly endangers human health and well-being
and threatens environmental health and stability
- Continued advancements in low-cost, mobile sensing have dramatically increased
our ability to characterize the environment at spatial and temporal resolutions
relevant to human-scale interactions
- Additionally, a plethora of satellite missions have been recently launched (or
will soon be) which promise to provide petabytes of multi-spectral imagery
- However, the data provided by these systems are often limited to specific
physical quantities (e.g. reflectances) which are only indirectly related to water quality and air
quality parameters which we actually care about
- To make sense of these data, one can apply physical models which relate
measurements to parameters of interest
- However, these models are limited by the physics \textit{as we currently
  understand it} making it challenging to account for as yet undiscovered
relationships impacting the data 
- Additionally, simulating the dynamics of physical systems at scale demands 
significant computational resources limiting real-time applicability.
- For example, ECMWF meteorological forecasts are provided a (add spatial and
temporal resolution) despite the fact the many studies across the scientific
literature suggest relevant spatial scales between 0-1 km and temporal scales at
the order of 10 seconds for air quality.
- Machine learning offers a suite of data-driven methods to take advantage of
large datasets to extract meaningful relationships between 


% Amidst the rapid pace of global change, accurately assessing water and air quality is crucial for protecting the environment and safeguarding human health and well-being.

% Traditional monitoring methods are often insufficient to capture the complex and
% dynamic nature of these environmental systems, necessitating the development of
% advanced data collection and modeling techniques.


\section{Dissertation Goals}


The goal of this dissertation is to advance physical sensing in service of society by demonstrating the use of new techniques from physics-based machine learning on a variety of real world data sets. Towards this end, this work presents a collection of case studies utilizing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques in a variety of contexts together with physical sensing to produce actionable environmental insights. The applications of this research apply widely across many scientific domains including remote sensing, time series analysis, air quality, chemical kinetics, and data assimilation.

What is machine learning

Use of machine learning in the physical sciences

\begin{itemize}
  \item Remote sensing (inter-instrument calibration, classification, object identification, change monitoring via the NDVI and similar indices, etc.)
  \item Protein Folding
  \item Drug discovery
  \item Surrogate modeling (i.e. for PDE solvers - now very popular at NVIDIA)
\end{itemize}




\section{Physics-based Machine Learning}

The general problem of ML is hard with when no structure is assumed on data (include example of pit bull or potato)

For situations involving data from physical sensors describing real systesm, physics tells us there are underlying rules which govern the dynamics of real systems

When applying ML we should therefore place a high value on physics-based models, i.e. machine learning models tailord for the specific physical system, rather than generic abstract algorithms. This is important in all stages of the ML pipeline from feature selection (Robot team supervised), dimensionality reduction (i.e. the latent space of the GTM and GSM), model selection, model evaluation, etc. In summary:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Prefer interpretable models (e.g. deicsion trees) to black boxes
  \item Prefer probabilistic models (e.g. GTM vs SOM) to deterministic models (all data has uncertainty and no model is perfect)
  \item Prefer models which incorporate prior knoweldge of the physical system such as dynamical laws, symmetries, natural constraints, etc. This is specifically known as \textbf{physics-informed} machine learning or \textbf{scientific machine learning}  (SciML).
\end{itemize}
