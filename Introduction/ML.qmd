# Machine Learning, Physics-Informed Machine Learning, Scientific Machine Learning

## overview of types of ML 

## explain NN (i.e. neural network as a function + universal approximator) 

## explain Physics Informed NN(s)

## explain SciML + UDE framework

## use RLC circuit instead of Spring mass to introduce the concept

## methods I've developed

- Ensembling and Super Learners
- Self Organizing Maps 
- Generative Topographic Mapping
