\begin{biosketch}
  John Waczak received his BS in Physics and Mathematics from Oregon State
  University. Interested in combining his passions for modeling, programming,
  and electronics, he then pursued a graduate degree in Physics at the
  University of Texas at Dallas where he conducted research under Dr. David Lary
  at the center for Multi-scale Integrated Interactive Intelligent Sensing and
  Simulation for Actionable Insights (MINTS). His research leverages methods from
  machine learning to analyze data from physical sensing systems to produce
  environmental insights in service of society.
