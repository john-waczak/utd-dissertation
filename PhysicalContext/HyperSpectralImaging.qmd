## Hyperspectral Imaging


The following are notes from the Manolakis textbook that I originally kept [here](https://github.com/john-waczak/dissertation/blob/main/notes/remote_sensing/Manolakis/Introduction.md). NOTE: we will need to either make new figures or correctly cite these for attribution.

### Hyperspectal Imaging Sensors

- **Hyperspectral Sensors** aka imaging spectrometers
  - scanning mechanism
  - imaging system
  - spectrometer
- 3 types of resolution 
1. spatial 
2. spectral 
3. radiant 
4. (temporal?)

#### Spectral-Spatial Data Collection and Organization 
- Data collected into **Data Cube**
  - 2 spatial dimensions, 1 spectral dimension

![Pushbroom](./figures/pushbroom.png)

- Different types of rigs: 
  - Pushbroom scanner (ours) 
  - Staring System 
  - Fourier Transform Imaging Spectrometer (FTIS) 
  
#### Spatial Sampling 
- ground resolution elements are mapped to picture elements (pixels) 
- **IFOV**: Instantaneous Field of View
- **Cross track dimension** the projection of the long axis of the slit (i.e. the axis of the pushbroom sensors)
- **Along track dimension** the direction accumulated by traveling 
- **Ground Sample Distance** physical size of projected pixel element

#### Spectral Sampling 
- Recovery of spectral info is *imperfect* due to finite sampling 
- **Spectral Response Function** is the weighing function that describes the wavelengths that are transmitted to a particular spectral sample 

#### Radiometric Sampling
- detector transforms  radiant power to electrical signal 
- electrical signal converted to numbe via analog-to-digital converter
- photon detectors 

#### Signal Consideratiosn 
Strength of signal is determined by: 
- *Terrain composition* $\to$ affects amount of radiant energy reflected/emitted from ground resolution element
- *Range* Intensity drops off by inverse square law. Further you are away, the worse the signal
- *Spectral Bandwidth* output signal of detector element is proportional to spectral bandwidth of the detector
- *Instantaneous Field of View* Decreasing IFOV increases spatial resolution but weakens the signal
- *Dwell Time* the time required to sweep the IFOV across the ground resolution element, i.e. the time-on-pixel. Longer dwell time $\to$ more accumulated photons $\to$ more signal.
