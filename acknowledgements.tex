  Completing this work would not have been possible without the help and support
  of many people in my life. Simply put: it took a village.
  First and foremost, I extend my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr.
  David Lary for his wisdom, inspiration, and guidance across our various
  research projects. I could not have asked for a better mentor. I also extend my
  thanks to my committee members for their valuable insights and feedback.

  Next, I'd like to acknowledge my colleagues in the MINTS
  research group. Major thanks go to Adam Aker, Shawhin Talebi, Ashen
  Fernando, and Lakitha Weijeratne for the insightful discussions during our
  group meetings and the feedback they provided
  on my research manuscripts. Additionally, I thank David Schaefer, Prabuddha
  Dewage, Mazhar Iqbal, Gokul Balagopal, Matthew Lary, and Tatiana Lary for
  their assistance during our robot team field deployments.

  Lastly, none of this would have been possible without the support of
  family and friends. Their persistent motivation kept me sane across
  three moves, a global pandemic, and countless late-night debugging sessions.
